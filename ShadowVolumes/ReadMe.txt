This is a C++/GLSL application for shadow computation through shadow volumes.

It was implemented based on two documents:

	- Traditional Shadow Volume proposed in "Shadow Algorithms for Computer Graphics" by F. Crow in 1977

	- Stencil Shadow Volume proposed in "Real Shadows Real Time" by T. Heidmann in 1991;

The application was developed to compute ground-truth hard shadows for a given scenario. It is accurate, but not optimized in terms of performance.
