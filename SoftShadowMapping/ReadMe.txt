This is a C++/GLSL application for shadow computation through soft shadow mapping.

It was implemented based on the following papers:

	- Shadow Mapping proposed in "Casting Curved Shadows on Curved Surfaces" by L. Willians in 1978;

	- Monte-Carlo Soft Shadow Volumes/Shadow Mapping proposed in "Generating Soft Shadows with a Depth Buffer Algorithm" by L. Brotman and N. Badler in 1984;

	- Accumulation Buffer proposed in "The Accumulation Buffer: Hardware Support for High-Quality Rendering" by P. Haeberli and K. Akeley in 1990;
