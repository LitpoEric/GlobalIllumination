This is a C++/GLSL application for shadow computation through soft shadow mapping.

It was implemented based on the following papers:

	- Shadow Mapping proposed in "Casting Curved Shadows on Curved Surfaces" by L. Willians in 1978;

	- Summed-Area Tables proposed in "Summed-Area Tables for Texture Mapping" by F. Crow in 1980;

	- Monte-Carlo Soft Shadow Volumes/Shadow Mapping proposed in "Generating Soft Shadows with a Depth Buffer Algorithm" by L. Brotman and N. Badler in 1984;

	- Accumulation Buffer proposed in "The Accumulation Buffer: Hardware Support for High-Quality Rendering" by P. Haeberli and K. Akeley in 1990;

	- G-Buffer proposed in "Comprehensible Rendering of 3-D Shapes" by T. Saito and T. Takahashi in 1990;

	- Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows proposed in "Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows" by R. Fernando in 2005;

	- Summed-Area Tables in GPU proposed in "Fast Summed-Area Table Generation and Its Applications" by J. Hensley et al. in 2005;

	- Hierarchical Shadow Map proposed in "Real-Time Soft Shadow Mapping by Backprojection" by G. Guennebaud et al. in 2006;

	- Summed-Area Variance Shadow Mapping proposed in "Summed-Area Variance Shadow Mapping" by A. Lauritzen in 2007;

	- Variance Soft Shadow Mapping proposed in "Variance Soft Shadow Mapping" by B. Yang et al. in 2010;
