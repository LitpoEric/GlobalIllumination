This is a C++/GLSL application for hard shadow mapping.

It supports the following techniques:
	- Traditional Shadow Mapping proposed in "Casting Curved Shadows on Curved Surfaces" by L. Willians in 1978;
	- Percentage-Closer Filtering proposed in "Rendering Antialiased Shadows with Depth Maps" by W. Reeves, D. Salesin and R. Cook in 1987;
	- Variance Shadow Mapping proposed in "Variance Shadow Maps" by W. Donnelly and A. Lauritzen in 2006;
	- Exponential Shadow Mapping proposed in "Exponential Shadow Maps" by T. Annen et al. in 2008;
	- Exponential Variance Shadow Mapping proposed in "Layered Variance Shadow Maps" by A. Lauritzen and M. McCool in 2008;
	- Shadow Map Silhouette Revectorization proposed in "Shadow Map Silhouette Revectorization" by V. Boundarev in 2014;
	- Moment Shadow Mapping proposed in "Moment Shadow Mapping" by C. Peters and R. Klein in 2015;
